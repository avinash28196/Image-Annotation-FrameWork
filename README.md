# Image-Annotation-FrameWork-
In the recent years Image Annotation has picked up a significance in the process of searching, retrieving and applying labels for images.The project involves in identifying and recognizing the objects within the given image using predefined neural network learning algorithms and tools. The model also includes recognition of complex images using partially annotated datasets for improved annotation process. The model accomplishes two major tasks: Initially, to explain with labels and later to segment the picture with the comparable area, such that the expectation of the overall model will be useful in computer vision. The proposed model is carried out using MatLab and ImageNet dataset. The performance of the system demonstrates the presence of correct- ness within the inputted image using labels (tags) and partitioning pictures from different classes portraying to various scenes.
